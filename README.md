# Investment Portfolio Simulation

## Overview

This C++ program simulates the growth of an investment portfolio over time, calculating the portfolio's value, monthly dividends, and cumulative dividends. The simulation runs until the portfolio's annual dividends reach a specified target. The program outputs the results of the simulation to a text file in a tabular format.

## Features

- **User-Specified Inputs:** 
  - Initial investment amount
  - Monthly investment contribution
  - Target annual dividends

- **Stock-Specific Inputs:** 
  - Initial dividend yield
  - Dividend growth rate
  - Stock growth rate

- **Simulation Outputs:**
  - Monthly updates on portfolio value, monthly dividends, and cumulative dividends
  - Total time required to reach the target annual dividends
  - Final portfolio value and total dividends received

## How It Works

1. **Input Parameters:**
   - The user defines the initial investment, monthly investment, target annual dividends, initial dividend yield, dividend growth rate, and stock growth rate.
  
2. **Growth Rates:**
   - The program calculates the monthly stock growth rate and the monthly dividend growth rate based on the provided annual rates.

3. **Simulation Loop:**
   - The program simulates the portfolio's growth month by month, updating the portfolio's value and dividends.
   - The loop continues until the annual dividends generated by the portfolio meet or exceed the target annual dividends.

4. **Output:**
   - The results of each month are written to a file named `investment_output_data.txt`.
   - The output includes the year, month, portfolio value, monthly dividends, and cumulative dividends.

5. **Final Summary:**
   - Once the target is reached, the program outputs the total time taken, final portfolio value, final annual dividends, and cumulative dividends received.

## File Output

The program writes the results to a file named `investment_output_data.txt`. The file contains a table with the following columns:

- **Year:** The year of the simulation.
- **Month:** The month within the current year.
- **Portfolio Value:** The total value of the portfolio at the end of the month.
- **Monthly Dividends:** The dividends received for the current month.
- **Cumulative Dividends:** The total dividends received up to and including the current month.

The file also includes a summary at the end, detailing the total time required to reach the target, final portfolio value, final annual dividends, and cumulative dividends.

## How to Run

1. **Compile the Program:**
   Use a C++ compiler to compile the program. For example:
   ```bash
   g++ -o investment_simulation investment_simulation.cpp

2. **Run the Program:**
Execute the compiled program:
```bash
./investment_simulation

## Customization

To customize the simulation, adjust the following variables in the code:

- `initial_investment`: Set the initial amount of money invested.
- `monthly_investment`: Set the amount added to the investment each month.
- `target_annual_dividends`: Define the desired annual dividend target.
- `initial_dividend_yield`: Set the starting dividend yield percentage.
- `dividend_growth_rate`: Set the annual dividend growth rate.
- `stock_growth_rate`: Set the annual stock growth rate.

## Dependencies

This program requires a C++ compiler that supports the C++11 standard or later. The program includes the following libraries:

- `<iostream>`: For input and output operations.
- `<cmath>`: For mathematical functions like `pow`.
- `<fstream>`: For file handling operations.
- `<iomanip>`: For output formatting.

## Output Example

Upon completion, the program displays a message indicating that the results have been written to `investment_output_data.txt`. The final lines of the output file provide a summary of the simulation results, including the time taken to reach the target and the final portfolio value.
